## [Trello](https://trello.com) Integration with [Habitica](https://habitica.com)
This Power-Up([?](https://trello.com/en/guide/power-up-productivity)) will keep your Trello cards in sync with Habitica. **No coding is required**; just fill in the form and you're all set!

## How to use?
Each Power-Up is associated with a team. Once a Power-Up has been added to a team, it will be available to all of the boards that belong to that team. So [create a team](https://trello.com/en/guide/create-a-team.html) if you don't have one.

To add a new Power-Up to your team, navigate to the [Power-Ups Administration page](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin), choose your team and click **Create a Power-Up**.

Now it's time to fill in the form.

1. First, name your Power-Up.
2. To work properly this Power-Up requires some permissions. Make sure you've checked all of the following:
  * board-buttons
  * callback
  * card-badges
  * card-buttons
  * card-detail-badges
  * list-actions
3. Provide the URL to your Power-Up.
  * The easiest way is to use the url provided below. As a bonus you will receive all upcoming updates without any changes from your side.  
  `https://alexktzk.github.io/trello-habitica`  
  * Or you can fork this repository, publish **gh-pages** branch to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and use your own url.
4. Now you can navigate to one of the boards of the team and activate your Power-Up! You will find it in the **Custom** section.
5. Finally, click the list menu (three dots) and select either "Mark list as Doing" or "Mark list as Done."
